#🌌 Welcome to TheHaqHub’s Tech Journey! 🚀

Hi! I’m @TheHaqHub — I moved from studying medicine to writing code! 🩺➡️💻
Now I’m learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and really enjoying JavaScript. I like building apps and fixing bugs. Even small things like why "2" > 1 is true can surprise me (crazy, right? 🤯)

🌟 My Journey
From Medicine to Code: I left medicine and started learning how to build apps.

Learning MERN Stack: I’m working on MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Right now, I’m learning React hooks and how to make good APIs.

Things I’ve Done:

Made a simple one-page HTML project 🔥

Made my js-repo better — here’s my String Interpolation demo!

What I’m Building Now: A pet adoption app using the MERN stack (because pets + code = 🐶💕)

🛠️ Skills & Tools
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, Python

Tools: VS Code, Git, Postman

Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express

Fun Fact: I once fixed a WordPress problem in 10 minutes ⚡

🤝 Let’s Connect
I’m happy to work on MERN projects or any web apps. If you have a cool idea or want to build something together, email me at ahkhan0566@gmail.com.

Pet Adoption App (WIP): I’m making an app to help pets find homes. Stay tune.
