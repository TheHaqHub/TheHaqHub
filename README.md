👋 Welcome to TheHaqHub's Tech Universe! 🚀

Hey there, I'm @TheHaqHub—a tech enthusiast diving deep into the MERN stack and conquering the wild world of code! Whether it's wrestling MongoDB queries or taming JavaScript type coercion (yep, "2" > 1 is my kind of chaos), I'm all about building sleek apps and solving quirky bugs with a grin. 😄
🌟 What I'm Up To

Learning MERN Stack: Crafting full-stack apps with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Currently mastering React hooks and dreaming of scalable APIs!
Recent Wins: Built a 🔥 HTML one-shot project and streamlined my js-repo workflow. Check it out here!
Next Quest: Creating a MERN-based pet adoption app (because who doesn't love coding and cute pets? 🐶).

💻 Tech I Love

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java (and a soft spot for Python)
Tools: VS Code, Git, Postman
Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express
Fun Fact: I once debugged a WP_CRON error in record time—take that, WordPress! ⚡

🤝 Let's Collaborate!
Got a cool MERN project or a wild JavaScript idea? I'm your coder! Looking to team up on:

Open-source web apps
Portfolio sites with slick UIs
Fun side projects (maybe a JS-based game? 🎮)

Drop me a message on Twitter or email me at thehaqhub@example.com. Let's build something epic!
🎉 Fun Facts About Me

Pronouns: He/Him
Journey: Swapped stethoscopes for keyboards—yep, I went from medicine to coding and never looked back!
Quirk: I name my variables after sci-fi characters (looking at you, captainQuerySelector).
Current Mood: while(coffee > 0) { code(); }

📊 My Coding Adventure

🛠️ Featured Projects

js-repo: A playground for my JavaScript experiments—type coercion galore!
Pet Adoption App (WIP): A MERN stack app to connect pets with forever homes. Stay tuned!


⭐ Pro Tip: "Code" + "Coffee" = 🚀Thanks for stopping by! Let's make the web a more awesome place together. 😎
